The Ubersystem Project
=======

The Ubersystem Project is a web app written in Python and designed for high customization to suit any event's needs. It's aimed largely at fandom events and can track things like registration, events, staffers, groups, dealers, jobs, game checkouts, etc.

This app was originally developed by [MAGFest](http://magfest.org) as their internal registration system, named Ubersystem, and is now open source and available for anyone to use. Eternal thanks to [Eli Courtwright](https://github.com/EliAndrewC) for tirelessly developing Ubersystem for ten years.

Installation / Development
===========================

Check out the docs [Here](INSTALL.md) for information on how to install or setup a MAGFest-specific development environment.
