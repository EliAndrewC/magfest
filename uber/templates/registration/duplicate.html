    If you're <strong>absolutely</strong> sure that this is someone else, please confirm this. We highly recommend
    editing the attendee's name if at all possible, as badges with duplicate names may be picked up by the wrong
    person.
    {% if attendee.paid == c.PAID_BY_GROUP and attendee.group.status == c.WAITLISTED %}
        Please keep in mind that dealers have an option to buy their badge once the Marketplace fills up, so you
        normally do not need to create an additional badge for them.
