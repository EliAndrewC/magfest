Dear {{ group.leader.full_name }},

Thank you for submitting an application for {{ group.name }} to appear in the {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Marketplace this coming {{ event_dates() }}!  We'll be reviewing all applications, and will let you know as soon as possible if yours have been approved.  Please understand that due to the number of applications we receive, it may take awhile for you to get a response; however, you will be notified if you have been approved, waitlisted, or declined.  

{% if attendee.requested_hotel_info and c.PREREG_REQUEST_HOTEL_INFO_OPEN -%}
In the coming days, you'll be emailed a link to a page with instructions on booking a room. This link will not initially be announced publicly, it will be sent to people registered for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} first, so keep a lookout for the e-mail in case it goes into your spam folder. Receiving the link does not guarantee you a room.
{%- endif %}

Thank you!

{{ c.MARKETPLACE_EMAIL_SIGNATURE }}
