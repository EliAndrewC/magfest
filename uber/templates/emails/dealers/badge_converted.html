{{ attendee.first_name }},
<br/><br/>
Although your dealership ({{ group.name }}) was not approved to vend, we think
you may still want to come and enjoy all that {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} has to offer!
Therefore, we have reserved a badge for you{% if c.PRICE_BUMPS and attendee.badge_cost < c.BADGE_PRICE %} at
the price of registration when you first applied{% endif %}. Badges are available for purchase by
anyone in your group who had a valid email. Any unassigned badges were dropped.
<br/><br/>
Please note: the badge we have reserved for you is an ATTENDEE badge at the
price it would have been had you bought it instead of applying to be a dealer.
<strong>You were not accepted as a dealer, and will not have space in the Marketplace.</strong>
<br/><br/>
Please confirm or decline <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}">your attendee registration</a>.
We hope to see you this year!
