If you don't finish these items, you may get a friendly personal reminder* from MIVS.  Some items, such as Hotels or Selling, have hard dates and need to be completed by their due date.

If you have any questions, please email {{ c.MIVS_EMAIL|email_only }}

Forever Your Fan,

* Sending friendly reminders takes time away from our volunteers. You don't want that on your conscious, do you?
