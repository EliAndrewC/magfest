Congratulations!  Your game ({{ game.title }}) has made it past Round 1 judging for the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

Round 2, the final round, requires your team to submit your game in a playable form or a demo version of your game for the judges to play.

Rules for Round 2 submissions:

The deadline to submit your game is before October 7th, 2018.
After the deadline, updated builds will not be accepted.
Demos must have at least 15 minutes of game play.
If a registration/unlock code is required, please provide at least 5 codes for our judges or a single code which will work for all judges.
Judging will last until approximately November 4th.

Results will be posted November 5th, however we do value your patience as we make sure all games get the attention they deserve for judging.
