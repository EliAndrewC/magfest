    <h2>{% if AFTER_DEALER_REG_DEADLINE %}You've been added to our waitlist!{% else %}Thanks for applying as a Dealer!{% endif %}</h2>

    We've received your application for {{ group.name }} to purchase a Dealer registration for {{ EVENT_NAME }}.

    <br/><br/>
    {% if AFTER_DEALER_REG_DEADLINE %}
        Since the Dealer's Room is currently full, you've been added to our waitlist, and we'll let you know by the end
        of May if a spot opens up for you.
    {% else %}
        We receive a flood of applications every year, which we respond to in the order in which we receive them.
        Approvals will be done as promptly as possible; usually within <strong>two weeks</strong> from application.
    {% endif %}

    <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
    After approval, you will be emailed a link to manage your Dealership. From this link, you will be able to:
    <ul>
        <li>Pay for your Dealership, which includes the cost of tables and memberships.</li>
        <li>Register your selected Dealer Assistants.</li>
        <li>After your Membership and Table payment is received, you may add and pay for additional Dealer Assistants.
            They may also register and pay their own.</li>
    </ul>

    Your Dealership Payment includes your table cost, your Dealer Membership, and any selected Dealer Assistant
    Memberships.  After payment, you'll be sent a link by email to follow if you wish to later upgrade your membership.
    Your Dealer Assistants will be able to upgrade their own memberships and pay for those upgrades on their own.

    <br/><br/>Later, you will receive an additional email about your placement within the Dealer's Room.

    <br/><br/>In the event we cannot accommodate your Dealership, you will receive an email. By default, you will still
    receive a Membership to Anthrocon, and it will be changed from Dealer to Attending (or Dealer+Sponsor to Sponsor, etc).
