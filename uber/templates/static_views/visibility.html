<p>
If you are having trouble filling your shifts, changing the visibility may
help. The options are described below:
</p>

<b>Members of this department</b>
<p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 3px;">
  This is the default. Only staff/volunteers who have been assigned to
  your department may sign up for these shifts.
</p>

<b>Staff who've requested this dept or "Anywhere"</b>
<p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 3px;">
  Staff who have expressed interest in helping your department - either
  specifically or by being willing to help anywhere – may sign up for these
  shifts, even if they aren't assigned to your department.
</p>

<b>Staff & volunteers who've requested this dept or "Anywhere"</b>
<p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 3px;">
  Both staff and volunteers who have expressed interest in helping your
  department - either specifically or by being willing to help anywhere – may
  sign up for these shifts, even if they aren't assigned to your department.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Staff</b> have a staff badge and have worked previous events.<br>
  <b>Volunteers</b> have an attendee badge with a volunteer ribbon.
